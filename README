== NTHMP Tsunami Benchmark Problems -- Wiki Repository ==

* Volunteer BP Stewards are listed below for each Benchmark Problem, as part of the BP folder name.

* Contact a BP Steward through the e-mail address distributed with the Workshop Notes by Bill Knight and Rick Wilson.

* Stewards are responsible for organizing BP material to facilitate other modelers that want to run the BP.    For example ...

1. README file with an overview
2. Problem description
3. Explanatory figures
4. Test case parameters required by the NTHMP Mapping and Modeling Subcommittee for model approval
5. Input data needed to run the BP
6. ..., etc.

* Stewards should:

1. Organize the BP material in a folder on their own computer ... subfolders and any type of file or document can be used, including documents with URL hyperlinks to material at other sites.

2. Compress the folder ... tar or zip, e.g.

3. Send the file to our BP Wiki Webmaster, Paul Chamberlain ( pmc22 at uw.edu ) for uploading to your BP Wiki Folder, with a copy to Frank Gonzalez ( figonzal at u.washington.edu )
