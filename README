Volunteer BP Stewards are listed below for each Benchmark Problem,

Contact a BP Steward through the e-mail address distributed with
the Workshop Notes by Bill Knight and Rick Wilson.


Stewards are responsible for organizing BP material to facilitate
other modelers that want to run the BP.    For example ...

1. README file with an overview
2. Problem description
3. Explanatory figures
4. Test case parameters required by the NTHMP Mapping and Modeling 
   Subcommittee for model approval
5. Input data needed to run the BP
6. ..., etc.


Stewards should:
----------------

1. Organize the BP material in a folder on their own computer ...
subfolders and any type of file or document can be used, including
documents with URL hyperlinks to material at other sites.

2. Compress the folder ... tar or zip, e.g.

3. Send the file to our BP Wiki Webmaster, Paul Chamberlain ( pmc22
at uw.edu ) for uploading to your BP Wiki Folder, with a copy to
Frank Gonzalez ( figonzal at u.washington.edu )
